## Handling settings.py

We've included a sample `settings.py` file (named `settings.sample`) to get you started on getting the settings straightened out for your computer.

**Be sure to insert a randomly generated key under `SECRET_KEY`in your settings.py!**

## Rendering Views

The templates for data_app are found in the `templates` directory under `data_app`.  This keeps us from having to specify different template directories in `settings.py` for each machine.
